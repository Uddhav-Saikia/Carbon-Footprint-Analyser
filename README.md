# Carbon Footprint Calculator Project Report

## Introduction

The Carbon Footprint Calculator is a web application developed using React.js and Chart.js. This project aims to help individuals and organizations estimate their carbon footprint by considering various scope-wise parameters, including Scope 1 (fossil fuel and fugitives), Scope 2 (electricity), and Scope 3 (water and waste). This calculator provides a user-friendly interface for data input and visualizes the carbon emissions data using interactive charts.

## Features

### 1. Scope-wise Parameters

The Carbon Footprint Calculator allows users to input data for different scopes of carbon emissions, including:

- **Scope 1: Fossil Fuel Emissions**
  - Users can enter data related to fossil fuel consumption, such as gasoline, diesel, and other direct emissions.

- **Scope 1: Fugitive Emissions**
  - This section allows users to input data related to fugitive emissions, including methane and other greenhouse gases released from various sources.

- **Scope 2: Electricity Consumption**
  - Users can input data regarding electricity consumption, helping them understand the indirect emissions associated with their energy usage.

- **Scope 3: Water and Waste**
  - This section allows users to enter data related to water consumption and waste generation, providing a comprehensive overview of their environmental impact.

### 2. Calculation and Visualization

- The application calculates the total carbon footprint by summing up emissions from all three scopes.

- Interactive charts generated using Chart.js provide users with a visual representation of their carbon emissions data. These charts help users gain insights into which areas contribute the most to their carbon footprint.

### 3. User-Friendly Interface

- The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily input data and view results.

- Clear instructions and tooltips are provided to guide users in entering accurate data.
- The user can either fill out a form, or upload a populated excel sheet and get the results.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: For server-side computations of the data from the Excel Sheets.
- **Chart.js**: Chart.js is used for creating interactive charts that display carbon emissions data.
- **ExcelJS** : For calculations of emission values from the excel sheet uploaded by the user.

## Installation

To run the Carbon Footprint Calculator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone `

2. Navigate to all the directories calculator/dashboard/backend: `cd carbon-calculator/calculator`,`cd carbon-calculator/dashboard`,`cd carbon-calculator/backend`

3. Install dependencies in the respective directories: `npm install`

4. Start the development server to start the frontend, either for calculator or for dashboard: `npm start`

5. Naviage to the backend folder using `cd ../backend` and run `node backend.js` to start the backend server.
